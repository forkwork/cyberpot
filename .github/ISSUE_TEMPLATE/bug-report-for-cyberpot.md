# ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic support information (commands are expected to run as `root`)

**We happily take the time to improve CyberPot and take care of things, but we need you to take the time to create an issue that provides us with all the information we need.** 

- What OS are you CyberPot running on?
- What is the version of the OS `lsb_release -a` and `uname -a`?
- What CyberPot version are you currently using (only **CyberPot 24.04.x** is currently supported)?
- What architecture are you running on (i.e. hardware, cloud, VM, etc.)?
- Review the `~/install_cyberpot.log`, attach the log and highlight the errors.
- How long has your installation been running?
  - If it is a fresh install consult the documentation first.
  - Most likely it is a port conflict or a remote dependency was unavailable.
  - Retry a fresh installation and only open the issue if the error keeps coming up and is not resolved using the documentation as described [here](#how-to-raise-an-issue).  
- Did you install upgrades, packages or use the update script?
- Did you modify any scripts or configs? If yes, please attach the changes.
- Please provide a screenshot of `htop` and `docker stats`.
- How much free disk space is available (`df -h`)?
- What is the current container status (`dps`)?
- On Linux: What is the status of the CyberPot service (`systemctl status cyberpot`)?
- What ports are being occupied? Stop CyberPot `systemctl stop cyberpot` and run `grc netstat -tulpen`
  - Stop CyberPot `systemctl stop cyberpot`
  - Run `grc netstat -tulpen`
  - Run CyberPot manually with `docker compose -f ~/cyberpot/docker-compose.yml up` and check for errors
  - Stop execution with `CTRL-C` and `docker compose -f ~/cyberpot/docker-compose.yml down -v`
- If a single container shows as `DOWN` you can run `docker logs <container-name>` for the latest log entries
